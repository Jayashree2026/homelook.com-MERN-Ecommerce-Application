# Homelook.com - MERN eCommerce Website for Home Decor

## Project Overview
I worked on this project **Homelook.com**, an **eCommerce website for home decor** built using **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**. The project is fully deployed online using **Vercel** for both frontend and backend.

In this project, I learnt how to build and deploy a full-stack eCommerce website. Users can explore products, filter and sort them, select variants like size, add products to the cart, and place orders using either **Cash on Delivery** or **Online Payment** options. We integrated **Stripe** and **Razorpay** to enable online payments.  

The project also includes an **Admin Dashboard** where the admin can add, update, or delete products, view all products, and manage orders. The backend APIs are developed using **Node.js and Express**, and all data (users, products, orders) are stored in **MongoDB**.
